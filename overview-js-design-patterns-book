THIS IS JUST MY  PERSONAL OVERVIEW 
About the book Learning JavaScript Design Patterns [by Addy Osmani].

It's just a shot of my feeling, experiencing the reading of it, based on my background.

It's not intended to be a judgment (I am not such a top dev ;-) ) but just a help (I hope) for someone that could have some doubt about read it or not.

Not so recent, it has a lot of references to Backbone and Knockout and other stuff that could be considered "maybe not so relevant yet", but still valuable to understand the context we're moving right now and to have a more accurate overview.

About the chapter of "importance of decoupling app", just give it a view to know what was before ES6 I guess.

I found the final part very useful for my background. 
I used jQuery so much in the past years, that analyzing which design patterns are used inside of it, give me a very good link into my mind. 

Not so useful the middle-final part about the patterns to create jQuery plugin that I have read just for the sake of completeness (but has a lot of examples you can use in case you are into it). 

After that, I found the chapter about namespacing patterns quite interesting.

It brings a lot of references at the end that could be interesting.
