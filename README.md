# Stay consistent as a front-end web developer

Here are some resources, books, YouTube channels etc. that I found profoundly useful
to stay consistent as a front-end web dev.

I would love to put together a good list that could remain essential and very very useful, so not a very long or verbose but a very concise and straight to the point one.

This is not a list for beginners but a list for who is already a front-end web dev pro and is constantly trying to become a better dev every day, step by step, in both directions, consolidating the base and going forward on the top, learning the new stuff.

Here's a nice start.



###BOOKS (you can find in this repo)
- Design Patterns Elements of reusable Object-Oriented Software [by GOF];
- JavaScript: The Good Parts [by Douglas Crockford]
- Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist [by Allen B. Downey] (you can read it online here: http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/index.html) [NOT a front-end book but very useful to learn a programming thinking process]

###VIDEO
- Philip Roberts: What the heck is the event loop anyway? | JSConf EU 2014 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ] (With some handy visualisations, and fun hacks, letâ€™s get an intuitive understanding of what happens when JavaScript runs.)
- Comparing Yourself To Others [Advice] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IAV6R7vlrw] (how to stay motivated and don't be discouraged)

###YOUTUBE CHANNELS (useful and also fun)
- The Coding Train: [https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/] [this guy brought the fun of programming back];
- Fun Fun Function: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q/] [nice to have a 'js show' and not just tutorials];
- DevTips: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyIe-61Y8C4_o-zZCtO4ETQ];
- Wes Bos: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoebwHSTvwalADTJhps0emA];

###OTHER

###TIPS
- find a way to create a good habit for it;
- do not force too much yourself but keep on searching for the fun side of learning new stuff, it's crucial to be very effective;
- do not bring you down, always comparing yourself to others, everyone has strengths and weaknesses, and everything looks better from far away.
